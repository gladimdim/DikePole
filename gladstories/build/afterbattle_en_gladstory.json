    "description": "At the beginning of the XVII century a confrontation flares up between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. As a result of a devastating defeat at the Battle of Cecora, a lot of noblemen, Cossacks, and soldiers are killed or captured by Turks and Tatars. The fate of a young Cossack, wayfaring through the Wild Fields in a desperate attempt to escape from captivity, depends on the choices of the reader of this interactive fiction. All the challenges are equally hard: surviving in the steppe, avoiding the revenge of the Tatars, winning the trust of the Cossack fisherman and returning home. But the battle that will change the course of history is fast approaching. Will the main character be able to participate in it and stay alive? And how will his life go from there? – Only you know the answer!",

A little further off on the shore, where the reeds gave place to steppe grass and sparsely growing trees, three men had settled near a fire. The runaway couldn’t see them, but he could sometimes hear fragments of their conversation and the clatter of provisions passed on by the wind. They were Tatars. Dmytro was trying to hear whether they were there for him.",

Up close, the wood showed signs of a forest fire – blackened tree trunks stuck out like poles, merging together and disappearing in the darkness. Behind the trees there was a slight hollow where a small brook flowed hidden from sight by several boulders the size of a horse-cart. The ground was covered by a thick layer of cold ashes."

The scabbard, made from rough leather, would have been a simple one if not for the moldings on it and the semiprecious stone at its center. There was no dagger in the knapsack.

The Tartar’s tinder and firesteel had come in handy. The Cossack lit a fire, hoping that the hollow behind the bolder would help him hide the fire. The charred logs burned quickly and almost without any smoke, leaving behind glowing embers. In a small span of time, the Cossack had enough embers that he could start adding some bigger pieces of word to the fire. He found some twigs to create a makeshift bedding near the fire. Bringing some more logs to the fire, Dmytro spread the embers around the perimeter of the boulder. Worn and tired, he placed a jug with spring water right next to the fire to soften the dried bread and horse meat. The simple food and the warmth from the embers, which radiated from the tall boulders, finally warmed him up. The Cossack slept until dawn, waking up from time to time to add wood to the fire or to drink some water. At last, the sky was starting to clear up. A new day began."

There was only a pile of ash left from last night’s fire, but the surrounding boulders still preserved some of the warmth from the fire, keeping the morning cold at bay. The Cossack got up quickly, grabbed the knapsack, the bow and quiver of arrows, and set off for the opposite side of the hollow. He then turned left and, making a wide circle, returned to the edge of the burnt forest, a little way off from the place where he had entered the forest."
