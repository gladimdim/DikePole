Pesky gnats needled his face and neck. A little further off on the shore, where the reeds gave place to steppe grass and sparsely growing trees, three men had settled near a fire. The runaway couldn’t see them, but he could sometimes hear fragments of their conversation and the clatter of provisions passed on by the wind. They were Tatars. Dmytro was trying to hear whether they were there for him.","\n","^The Cossack lay like this for a long time, covering his head with his hands until it was completely dark. The wind increased, blocking out all other sounds except for the haunting song of the rustling reeds. The wispy clouds were driven westward, creating a covering for the weak light of the crescent moon. Dmytro couldn’t wait any longer. He had to do something. Gripping tightly a good combat knife, the only thing he managed to take from the boat when running away, he slowly crawled to the path that led to the river. He waited a while before getting up and, trying to step as lightly as possible, made his way to the river. There was no one on the dark path. He squatted and started to drink the cold river water, cupping it in his hand. From time to time, the moon and the thick clouds reflected on the river’s service. Suddenly, a girl’s face was seen. The man sprang back and stared at the spot where he had seen the bright eyes of a young girl. But there was nothing there – only the moonlight that sometimes shone through the clouds. He crossed himself and went back, whispering a prayer. Then he turned and made his way to where the wall of reeds ended.","\n","^The runaway had to crawl once again since the river bank had risen.

Soon, both fires disappeared in the fog. The first cold autumn night had come to the Wild Fields.","\n","^The reeds were replaced by grass, the grass by rocks, and the rocks by ravines.

The runaway headed towards the woods. As he did so, the smell of smoke became stronger. Up close, the wood showed signs of a forest fire – blackened tree trunks stuck out like poles, merging together and disappearing in the darkness. Behind the trees there was a slight hollow where a small brook flowed hidden from sight by several boulders the size of a horse-cart. The ground was covered by a thick layer of cold ashes.","\n","^The man settled near the boulder closest to the brook, holding the bow and arrow at the ready, and started to look through the Tartar’s knapsack.","\n","^The first thing he found was a firesteel tied to a gray bag that contained pieces of flint and tinder from burnt rags.

The charred logs burned quickly and almost without any smoke, leaving behind glowing embers. In a small span of time, the Cossack had enough embers that he could start adding some bigger pieces of word to the fire. He found some twigs to create a makeshift bedding near the fire. Bringing some more logs to the fire, Dmytro spread the embers around the perimeter of the boulder. Worn and tired, he placed a jug with spring water right next to the fire to soften the dried bread and horse meat. The simple food and the warmth from the embers, which radiated from the tall boulders, finally warmed him up. The Cossack slept until dawn, waking up from time to time to add wood to the fire or to drink some water. At last, the sky was starting to clear up.

The Cossack got up quickly, grabbed the knapsack, the bow and quiver of arrows, and set off for the opposite side of the hollow.

One of the riders leaned in his saddle to take a closer look of something in the grass. He called out and the other riders retreated a little from the forest, maintaining the same distance between themselves.","\n","^The runaway slowly retreated into the woods, bending over and stepping as lightly as a lynx. Everything was silent for a moment when suddenly Dmytro heard rustling and the sound of twigs breaking. He froze in the clearing in the very center of the woods. Everything had been burnt to the roots here. Ravaged by the fire, only black tree trunks stuck out from the ground like poles. And yet, up ahead there was a thicket. Dmytro started running, but after a few steps he fell through into an ash-filled pit up to his waist. He got out of it and looked back at the traces left by his footsteps in the ashes. His pursuers were approaching. Dmytro felt as if he could hear their voices close by. In a couple of leaps, he was in the thicket. After the thicket, he found the familiar brook in the hollow. He jumped into it and ran in the direction of the current. As soon as the waterside started to jut out in the form a low cliff, Dmytro climbed onto it and ran until he came to a small chasm that was filled up with ashes, leaves and broken branches.

Not far in the steppe there was a small stallion with a saddle. The Cossack approached him, whispering words that he had learned as young boy when caring for horses, and looked into the animal’s eyes. Not meeting any resistance, he quickly mounted the horse and galloped off into the distance. In a few minutes, rain started to fall from the leaden sky, slowly but steadily soaking the russet dried grass of the steppe.","\n","^Dmytro rode through the steppe without stopping. Sometimes he changed directions as he approached the river, but as soon as he could see the shore, he turned to the steppe again. The rain fell without stopping, soaking Dmytro’s clothing and things. However, the sleep he had gotten the night before gave the Cossack strength, so he didn’t pay attention to such trifles. The steppe horse also proved to be a hardy creature, showing no signs of fatigue.

The light barely passed through the bottles inserted close to the ceiling of the earthen walls of the cabin. Dust and smoke circulated in the rays of light coming through the bottles. An icon of the Holy Virgin hung in the corner illuminated by a candle.","\n","^Dmytro was questioned about his origins and whereabouts. He told them how he was captured along with other Cossacks by the Tartars at Cecora, how he was taken to Crimea, and about his escape at the crossing during the confusion that ensued when someone suddenly attacked the Tartars.","\n","^All the men listened attentively. Then Dmytro was taken outside the cabin with the same precautions as when he had been taken in. He sat below a willow while the man with the gun guarded him. The runaway asked for some water. The guard carefully gave him a clay flask and allowed him to take a few sips. Soon about a dozen men emerged from behind the trees. Some of them Dmytro recognized from the earth cabin. A stocky man holding a long stick with a noose at one end stepped to the front of the crowd. “You are no captive Cossack, but a spy!”- He loudly proclaimed. The crowd shouted approvingly. The noose was thrown around Dmytro’s neck and he was pulled to the Dnipro. It was futile to resist and he almost had no strength left in him.","\n","^When he was near the water, someone offered him to pray for the last time. The runaway started to say something when a strange noise came from the clearing. A man ran along the path, waving his saber and shouting something. Suddenly, he swayed, made a few hesitant steps and collapsed. A crimson stain was quickly spreading on the back of his shirt. Someone ran up to him from the crowd that had gathered near the shore.

Then he cooked some grain in a copper jug over a small fire.","\n","^By then, it was completely dark. The night turned out to be clear, warm and starry. Dmytro left his camp and went to the edge of the island opposite to the one where he had landed. Cutting the reeds, he found that passage to the shore was quite clear here. The thickets weren’t so thick and near the shore there were a couple of stone blocks that created a small shelter. Dmytro left his clothing on the rocks and carefully entered the cold water of the Dnipro. Having entered the river up to his waist, he stopped, admiring the reflection of the stars in the water. Suddenly, he seemed to catch a glimpse of that young lady underwater again. Dmytro shook his head – it was most likely his weariness getting the better of him. Despite the cold, the bath brought a sense of relief and washed away the dust of his recent adventures. Returning to the shack, Dmytro barely waited for the fire to die down and fell soundly asleep.","\n","^In the morning, he quickly gathered, ate a little, and with the first light of dawn was already on the water. Up the current there was a network of straits and tributaries filled with countless small islands, and Dmytro hoped to continue his journey by hiding in the depths of this labyrinth. Currently, his goal was to cross the open space as quickly as possible before the sun had fully risen. Entering one of the straits, the runaway stopped paddling. The boat slid across the water without a sound. The current was much weaker here, so while the boat had stopped and started going backwards, Dmytro turned slightly and listened attentively. Then he made a couple of more strokes with the paddle, leveling the dugout canoe and guiding it forward. Repeating this movements many times, the Cossack slowly made his way through the thickets, trying not to lose his sense of direction. Even the current was no longer helping. In some areas it was hardly noticeable and in other areas the water seemed to move in a circle, pulling the boat into the center of the gyration. Suddenly, larger islands started to appear with patches of hard dry earth and even a couple of bushes. Dmytro went around these islands to the left, then to the right, until he approached a fairly large piece of land with several willows. The island was curved like a crescent moon, and Dmytro was approaching one of its tips while the other tip was visible from a distance. He led the boat to a small bay between the tips of the island. Dmytro surveyed the semicircle of the island’s sandy shore. At first, he didn’t see anything special, but a moment before he turned away something white flashed through the thickets. He vigorously paddled to turn back and surveyed the shallows once again. It seemed that in the depths of the island there was something white that resembled a piece of cloth tied to a tree or pole.","\n","ev","str","^Land on the island","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Move along","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"treasureisland"},"\n",{"#f":7}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"skiptreasure"},"\n","done",{"#f":7}]}],{"#f":3}],"#f":3}],"stay":[{"#":"image bulrush"},{"#":"image boat"},{"#":"image river"},{"#":"image steppe"},"^The Cossack looked more amidst the fire in search of useful things, but finding nothing, he gathered some firewood and loaded it into the boat. He didn’t want to spend the night in a place of carnage, so he pulled the body from the boat to the clearing and decided to sleep near the boat. Putting a branch on the side of the boat, Dmytro created a small shelter in case of bad weather. He built a campfire, dined on what he could find in the camp, and lay under the boat.","\n","^It was at this time that another night set in at the Wild Fields. Dmytro couldn’t fall asleep. It seemed to him that he could hear the neighing of a horse up on the cliffs. He got up, took his weapons and set of for the steep hills bordering the Dnipro. There was nobody near the ravine, so he decided to walk further into the steppe.

In a few steps, the quiet creaking of ashes beneath his feet turned into the rustling of fallen leaves. A little further, the stream flowed around a small spot of tall semi-dry grass. The Cossack got a knife and started to quickly and meticulously cut the grass, much as a reaper would gather a harvest of grain. Soon enough, he had a considerable heap in his arms. Dmytro carried it to his hiding place by the boulder and came back. In this way he cut the grass until he had cut down the whole patch. Then he took off his shirt, tied it into a knot and began to stuff it with leaves, trying his best to find the driest. It took a long time for him to carry the leaves, but at last Dmytro was satisfied with the result. A huge grass-covered pile had formed near the boulder. He shook his shirt, put it on, and climbed into the pile. He had warmed himself by carrying out this task, and now, laying in a pile of dry grass and leaves, he felt completely at rest. He ate a few pieces of dried bread from the Tartar’s knapsack and quickly fell asleep.","\n","^The sun was already shining through the layer of leaves. Dmytro realized that he had missed the sunrise. He carefully peered out of the makeshift bedding and looked around. There was a perceptible silence in the burnt forest, broken only by the running stream. The Cossack stretched his legs and approached the stream, scooping some cool water in his hands and washing his face. After that he took off his shirt and placed it on a nearby stone to wash the ashes and remnants of leaves from his body. After the wash in the stream, he felt his strength and appetite returning to him. He drank some spring water and ate some dried meat and bread to satiate his hunger.

Its remoteness from the forest had saved the tree from the fire, although strands of scorched grass wound up all the way to the foot of the slope. Dmytro reached the hill. Having climbed to the top, he left some of his things on the ground and climbed the tree. The steppe was silent and empty. Taking a good look around, Dmytro climbed down and inclined his head thoughtfully.

A wide lowland stretched beneath the slope. On the opposite side there was a valley overgrown with reeds, which twisted like a snake in the direction of the Dnipro. The lowland itself was leveled and flat like a plate, but in the middle, there was gray boulder with sharp edges. Between the hill and the valley, a cluster of trees and bushes grew in the form of a dark green stain. Another dark and almost circular stain was visible near the foot of the boulder. From his vantage point, Dmytro could make out several dark points on the ground. From one of them, a hardly visible gray thread rose into the air, swaying ever so slightly although there was no wind.","\n","^Dmytro had come here on instinct and was forced to catch his breath from surprise. The feeling of surprise quickly passed as he scrutinized the terrain below. The lowland was empty.","\n","^He slowly descended from the hill, keeping the view below in sight.

When he came out into the open, everything was covered in smoke, with arrows sticking out in different places. The main fight seemed to be somewhere up front. Suddenly, from behind the gray veil of smoke, two Tartars ran directly toward Dmytro. At the same time, something exploded near Dmytro’s left hand. He heard the whistle of artillery, and both of the Tartars fell down, struck by the pellets of a small canon. Dmytro ran forward and saw an opening on the side of a nearby hill from which smoke was coming from. Without stopping to look around, he entered the thick of the battle. At this very moment, the Cossacks were gaining ground on the Tartars, with the latter retreating towards the stream. A little longer and the Tartars were fleeing, sending volleys of arrows from hillsides to the valley. But soon the Cossacks overtook them, and the shooting stopped.","\n","^Somewhere above, gunshots still rang out, signaling the pursuit of the fugitives, but in the valley everything was quiet. The silence was broken by the moans of the injured that lay in the russet grass in puddles of blood. Surprisingly, there were no Cossacks among them. For a while, Dmytro stood to the side of the clearing, holding his bloodied sabre, until other Cossacks started to approach him, covered in dust, sweat and blood. One of them sat on the ground, catching his breath, another stood nearby, leaning on his rifle and looking up at the sky, another kindled a fire and lit his pipe. All were silent.","\n","^The Cossack that had interrogated Dmytro at the earthen cabin approached the clearing. He asked if anyone had been injured or killed. A few names were mentioned. He shook his head and ordered everyone to gather near the river. Then he turned to Dmytro: “So you didn’t run away? That’s good…We will decide what to do with you.” And he went to talk to the others. The group disbanded. The Cossacks walked along the valley, looking for their comrades, helping the wounded, and getting their things in order. Some of the dead were brought to the clearing and placed beneath the willows. They didn’t touch the dead Tartars, but only took their weapons.","\n","^Soon, everyone had gathered on the shore at the same place where they had come to drown Dmytro. Their otaman, the leader of the Cossacks, proclaimed that they would have to burn their outpost since the Tartars had learned about it. He ordered the Cossacks to prepare to leave and board their boats. Then he reminded the warriors about Dmytro. They were keeping an eye on him, but not with such hostility as before. Dmytro stepped forward and faced the Cossacks. “Did anyone see how this man fought in battle?” Asked the otaman. Several of the Cossacks nodded in agreement. “I also saw… I wouldn’t want to lose such a good swordsman.

For a very long time the only sounds he could hear were those of the wind, falling leaves and the murmur of the stream. Suddenly, a branch cracked on the ground.

Everyone was preparing to set sail.","\n","^Dmytro was approached by a short broad-shouldered man. He was called Ustym and he said that he was looking for volunteers to help transport two heavily injured warriors to a safe place. He hinted that Dmytro could help since he didn’t have any matters to attend to at the camp. The runaway agreed and they walked to the edge of the clearing where the injured lay beneath the willows. Not far away, one of the dead was being buried, his tomb already covered with heavy earth and stones. Close by on the trunk of a willow somebody had carved a wide cross, which was the only sign of mourning for this Cossack’s sad fate.","\n","^Two more volunteers approached, Ohrim and Ivan. Ustym decided that the four of them would manage on their own. He said that the journey wasn’t a long one.","\n","^They found a horse to transport the wounded, but there was no cart in the camp since the warriors mainly used boats to move along the river and rarely went out into the steppe to the Tartar coast. So Ustym brought axes and the team started to build a sledge that could be pulled by a horse. One of the volunteers – Ivan, as it turned out, was once a tinsmith, and he quickly created a harness from some ropes, belts and parts of old harnesses. Dmytro had his doubts whether the horse would pull the harness, but the beast turned out to be surprisingly docile when harnessed, obediently pulling the load.","\n","^The Cossacks hadn’t prepared for departure yet, but the wounded had to be taken away as quickly as possible. Sunset was quickly approaching and those who would transport the wounded couldn’t afford to set up camp on the road. The Cossacks agreed to leave a boat for the four volunteers, which the latter could use to catch up with the warriors on some shore that only Ustym knew about. Having finished their meeting and carefully placed the wounded Cossacks in the sledge, the volunteers set off. It was difficult to make their way out of the valley. In some places, they had to carry the sledge with the wounded in their arms. At last, they made it to the lowlands and quickly set off along the Dnipro, which though not visible, made its presence known by the rippling of the waves and the rushing wind.","\n","^Ivan led the horse and the others walked beside him. They all had sabers and bows while the wounded in the sledge had a loaded rifle lying next to them. From time to time, Dmytro gave the wounded some water to drink. The group tried to move without as quickly as possible without taking breaks. The sun was already setting over the Dnipro when the Cossacks reached the steep path leading into a valley. The lowland, however, was quite far away, covered in an ancient oak forest. The tops of the trees weren’t even visible from the level steppe. All around, fairly large boulders protruded from the ground. When the travelers entered the forest, the boulders increased in size, laying among the trees in a blanket of bright green moss. Moving around, surprisingly, wasn’t difficult since there was almost no shrubbery in the forest. The even ground was covered with a deep layer of leaves and there was a good distance between the trees and boulders. However, with time, the valley started to narrow and become steeper when, finally, the travelers found the themselves at the bottom of a deep ravine covered in dense thickets. At their feet warbled a small stream.","\n","^Ustym made a sign that they should stop. The group listened to the rustling leaves and the howling wind in the ravine. “Stay near the sledge, boys,” Ustym told Ivan and Dmytro, “We will see what’s out there.” Ohrim took the rifle and they both disappeared in the thickets.","\n","^Dmytro, Ivan and the two wounded warriors waited an hour for the Cossacks to return. When Ustym and Ohrim finally returned they were in a very good mood and seemed to be in no hurry. “Will we spend the night here?” Dmytro asked. “No, we are almost there,” replied Ustym, “Only the horse won’t go any further.” Indeed, as they moved forward, the shrubbery became so thick and tangled that it was hard for even one person to make it through. They stopped at a clearing surrounded by thickets on all sides. A semicircle of trees grew in the clearing, covering the passageway. Beneath the trees was a fire pit from rough stones and the remnants of some makeshift shelter. Ivan tethered the horse to a tree and the men carefully transported the wounded unto the grass. Using some pieces from the sledge, they quickly put together two litters for the wounded and continued their journey to the mysterious refuge on foot.","\n","^They scraped their way through the thickets, climbing between boulders that were almost close enough to crush the Cossacks with their weight. The tiny stream had long become their only source of direction. Finally, the passage widened a little but and the travelers entered a clearing that was a little bigger than the previous one, also surrounded by a wall of thickets. The stream ran adjacent to the clearing and seemed to come from a small cliff that hung over the ravine.","\n","^“We’ve arrived,” Ustym said at last. The men stopped and put the litters containing the wounded on the ground.","\n",{"->":".^.^.hermit"},{"#f":3}],"hermit":[{"#":"image cossacks"},{"#":"image forest"},"^The leader of the group came into the center of the clearing and made a sign with his hand, facing some blackthorn bushes. Having seen the sign, a tall elderly man emerged from the thickets. He had a beard and was dressed in shabby clothes. He had a large wooden cross on his neck. He looked like a hermit, but his garments were those of a Cossack and he had a pipe in his mouth. The bearded man had a bear spear in his hand that he leaned on as he would on a bishop’s staff. He walked past Ustym and, without saying a word, approached the wounded and bent over their litters. One of the men was conscious. “I see your death,” the old man muttered to him. “Your death is at your feet. It means you still have work to do in this world.” He stood up straight and went back into the shrubbery. The Cossacks picked up the litters and followed him.","\n","^A small hillock hid among the thickets. It turned out to be the entrance to an earthen cabin whose door was set deep in the earth, facing the cliff where the stream bubbled from. The bearded man opened the door and disappeared in the darkness. He came back with a burning candle in his hand and beckoned the Cossacks to carefully carry the wounded inside. The Cossacks carefully carried the litters down the narrow steps.","\n","^There was a whole cabin inside, containing several rooms and a clay stove, with tiny windows that were hardly noticeable from the outside. “Our men will come back soon. For now, fill up the barrel with water. It’s near the entrance along with a couple of pitchers,” the old man said.","\n","^While the Cossacks carried water, the bearded man tended to the wounded in a separate room. In a while, he went out and called the group to gather near the table. The travelers brought with them some goods from the camp. They gave them to the hermit.","\n","^After a quick meal, the old man asked: “Will you spend the night in my home? It is already dark outside.” “We kindly thank you, but we left our horse in the clearing. We will spend the night there,” one of the Cossacks replied.

Without their wounded comrades, they moved much quicker and were back at the clearing as the sun was rising. They quickly found the boat and provisions hidden in the reeds. From another hiding spot, Ivan brought out his saddle and harness. “The four of us and our provisions won’t fit in the boat. I will take the horse and ride to the crossing further up the stream. I will join you at the camp on the other shore,” he explained to them energetically. It was obvious that this plan had not been discussed before, but they also didn’t want to leave behind the horse and some provisions. Ustym somewhat reluctantly agreed.","\n","^They set off at noon, keeping close to the shore and paddling against the current towards the labyrinth of small islands, hidden among the reeds.","\n","^Ustym steered the boat along the narrow straits. For a while, Dmytro thought that they were lost, but finally the boat landed on one of the islands. Ustym told them to wait in the boat while he went on the island, carefully parting the reeds to pass through. He returned fairly quickly with a small chest in his hands, which was added to the other cargo in the boat. Without wasting time, they continued to move on. It seemed that the labyrinth of reeds was endless, but Ustym confidently steered the boat and, finally, close to dusk, their boat slid through the open water and in a couple of hours landed at the opposite shore. Here, among cliffs and thickets, was a comfortable passage to the shore. There was a deafening silence in the air and the shore seemed completely uninhabited, but as soon as the travelers stepped on land, they were surrounded by their fellow Cossacks.","\n",{"->":".^.^.winterstay"},{"#f":3}],"winterstay":[{"#":"image boat"},{"#":"image river"},{"#":"image cossacks"},"^In three days, the group reached the bleak cliffs that rose high above the Dnipro River, so steep that they seemed like great walls reaching towards the sky. The boat that was in front approached these stone giants and suddenly disappeared from sight. And after this boat, the next one vanished as well, and the one after that. When Dmytro’s boat reached the same cliff, he realized that it wasn’t solid.
